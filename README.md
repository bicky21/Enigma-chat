## Overview

Enigma Chat emerges as a response to the growing demand for secure digital communication spaces free from external oversight. Available at `https://p2p-ghost.glitch.me/`, it leverages peer-to-peer technology to facilitate direct messaging between participants, bypassing traditional server-centric models that often store user data. In its beta stage, the application reflects a work-in-progress status, balancing a stable core with opportunities for refinement based on real-world usage. The creator’s vision is to offer a lightweight, privacy-first chat solution that empowers users to communicate confidently, knowing their conversations are protected and transient by design.

The platform operates on a foundation of encrypted messaging, ensuring that only intended recipients can access the content of discussions. Hosted on a web-based environment, it’s accessible across various devices, making it versatile for both stationary and on-the-go use. The beta testing phase at `https://p2p-ghost.glitch.me/` serves as a public invitation to experience its features firsthand, report observations, and suggest enhancements, positioning Enigma Chat as a community-influenced project even while remaining proprietary.

## Features

Enigma Chat distinguishes itself with a suite of features tailored for security and ease of use:

- **Private Chat Rooms**: Users can create or join rooms identified by a unique 12-character code, consisting of letters, numbers, and special characters, paired with a secret passphrase for access.
- **Encrypted Communication**: All messages are safeguarded with advanced encryption, ensuring that only room participants can decrypt and read them, maintaining confidentiality throughout the session.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: The app supports instant messaging with visual cues, such as indicators showing when participants are typing, enhancing the live conversational experience.
- **QR Code Integration**: Rooms can be shared via QR codes that encode the room’s access link, allowing quick and error-free joining, especially convenient for mobile users.
- **User Activity Tracking**: A dynamic list displays all participants, highlighting who is currently active or inactive, providing visibility into room dynamics.
- **Data Ephemerality**: When the room creator leaves, the entire chat space and its history are erased; other participants’ exits clear their local views, reinforcing privacy.
- **Inactivity Management**: A 5-minute inactivity timeout automatically removes idle users, keeping rooms active and secure.
- **Device Compatibility**: The interface adapts seamlessly to desktop and mobile screens, ensuring accessibility regardless of the user’s device.

## Purpose and Design Philosophy

The primary purpose of Enigma Chat is to offer a secure, user-centric alternative to mainstream messaging platforms that often compromise privacy for convenience. By hosting it at `https://p2p-ghost.glitch.me/`, the creator ensures it’s readily available for testing while retaining full control over its proprietary nature. The design philosophy centers on three pillars: privacy, simplicity, and responsiveness. Privacy is achieved through encryption and peer-to-peer architecture, minimizing server-side data retention. Simplicity drives the minimalist interface, avoiding unnecessary features to focus on core chat functionality. Responsiveness ensures the app works intuitively across devices, from large desktop monitors to compact mobile screens.

The beta testing phase reflects an iterative approach, allowing real-world usage to inform improvements without opening the source to public modification. This balance enables the creator to maintain intellectual property rights while still benefiting from community feedback via the live deployment at `https://p2p-ghost.glitch.me/`.

## How It Works

Enigma Chat functions through a room-based system accessible via `https://p2p-ghost.glitch.me/`:
1. **Room Creation**: A user initiates a room by providing a passphrase, generating a unique identifier for that session.
2. **Room Sharing**: The creator shares the identifier directly or via a QR code, which links to the room’s URL.
3. **Joining Process**: Participants enter the identifier and passphrase to access the room, ensuring only authorized users can join.
4. **Messaging Flow**: Messages are encrypted on the sender’s device, transmitted in real-time, and decrypted by recipients, with the server acting solely as a relay.
5. **Session Management**: The creator’s departure terminates the room entirely, while other users’ exits clear their local chat logs, and inactivity prompts automatic disconnection.

This workflow ensures a secure, transient communication experience, aligning with the app’s privacy-first ethos.

## Usage Instructions

To engage with Enigma Chat during its beta phase:
- **Creating a Room**: Navigate to `https://p2p-ghost.glitch.me/`, enter a passphrase in the creation section, and generate a room. Share the resulting identifier or QR code with others.
- **Joining a Room**: Visit the same URL, input the room identifier and passphrase (or scan the QR code), and join the session.
- **Chatting**: Type messages in the provided input field, sending them via a button or the Enter key. Monitor incoming messages and user activity in the interface.
- **Exiting**: Leave the room using the designated button; creators end the session, while joiners retain the room’s continuity until then.

The live beta at `https://p2p-ghost.glitch.me/` requires no local setup, making it accessible to anyone with a web browser.

## Technical Foundation

Enigma Chat leverages modern web technologies for its beta deployment:
- Real-time communication is powered by a protocol ensuring low-latency message delivery.
- Peer-to-peer connections are facilitated for signaling, with messaging routed through a central relay for consistency.
- A server-side runtime environment coordinates connections and room states.
- Encryption is handled client-side using a standard cryptographic method, keeping message content secure.

The architecture prioritizes minimal server involvement, enhancing privacy and scalability within the beta constraints.
